# 🏥 Hospital Patient Analytics Dashboard

An interactive Power BI dashboard designed to analyze hospital operations, patient flow, clinical KPIs, and departmental performance to support data-driven healthcare decision-making.

---

## 📌 Short Description / Purpose

The Hospital Patient Analytics Dashboard provides a comprehensive view of patient admissions, length of stay, readmissions, department utilization, and clinical performance metrics. It helps healthcare stakeholders monitor efficiency, identify bottlenecks, and improve patient outcomes.

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:

• 📊 **Power BI Desktop** – Primary visualization platform  
• 🗄 **SQL (MySQL / SQL Server)** – Data extraction, joins, aggregation, and data preparation  
• 📂 **Power Query** – Data cleaning and transformation  
• 🧠 **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** – KPIs, measures, and calculated columns  
• 🧩 **Data Modeling** – Relationships between admissions, patients, departments, and diagnosis tables  
• 📁 **File Format** – `.pbix` for development and `.png` for dashboard previews

## 📂 Data Source

Source: Hospital patient dataset (simulated healthcare dataset).

The dataset includes:
- Patient admissions  
- Discharge details  
- Department information  
- Diagnosis categories  
- Length of stay  
- Readmission indicators  

Data was extracted using SQL queries and then cleaned and structured for analysis.

## ⭐ Features / Highlights

### 🔎 Business Problem

Hospitals generate large volumes of patient and operational data, but it is often difficult to quickly identify inefficiencies, patient flow issues, and department performance trends.

Key questions addressed:
- What is the average length of stay?
- Which departments handle the most patients?
- Where are readmissions highest?
- How is patient volume changing over time?

---

### 🎯 Goal of the Dashboard

To deliver an interactive analytics solution that:
- Tracks hospital operational KPIs  
- Helps monitor patient flow  
- Supports department performance analysis  
- Enables identification of high-risk patterns  
- Supports data-driven healthcare decisions
